      <description>Syncthing is a file synchronization tool that allows you to keep files and folders in sync across multiple devices. It works by creating a shared folder on one device and adding other devices to the folder. Any changes made to the files in the folder on one device are automatically synced to all the other devices in the folder. Syncthing is free, open-source, and available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and other platforms.</description>
